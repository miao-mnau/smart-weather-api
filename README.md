# Smart Weather API (8-Week Review Project)

This is a self-learning project to review and combine core Python backend skills. The goal is to build a simple, full-stack service that can:

1.  **(ETL)** Automatically fetch real-time weather data from a public API, transform it (`Pandas`), and load it into our own SQL database (`SQLAlchemy`).
2.  **(ML)** Use the stored historical data to train a simple `scikit-learn` prediction model.
3.  **(API)** Serve the model's "future weather predictions" via a RESTful API using `FastAPI`.

### Core Skills Being Reviewed:
* Python (OOP Principles)
* SQL (SQLAlchemy & MySQL)
* Data Processing (Pandas)
* Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
* API Development (FastAPI)
* Containerization (Docker & Docker Compose)
